# Circuit Breaker

Boba's owner Jill works in a big tech company. The only thing she cares about is getting her work done, making Boba very lonely :sob:. Notice me :pleading_face:!!!! Boba tries his best to catch their attention but nothing works. But now, Boba has acquired a super power - becoming microscopic! Boba has gotten into Jill's computer to mess up their system. "I'll make it so you can't work anymore and stay with me all the time 😤" - Boba. Help Boba get Jill fired 😈.

## Features

An original game created over the span of a weekend during the University of Manitoba's CSSA game jam. The theme is GLITCH. Boba 🐱 is creating glitches in Jill's computer 💻 so that she can't work and and can spend time with him 😄.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to lead Boba to the locations of minigames (the red wires). Press E to start a minigame. Once you finish a minigame, the wire will be frayed and create glitches in the system.
